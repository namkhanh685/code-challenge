# Scoreboard API Module Specification

## Overview

This module provides a real-time scoreboard system that tracks user scores and provides live updates to connected clients. The system ensures secure score updates through JWT authentication and delivers real-time notifications via SSE connections.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Secure Score Updates**: Protected API endpoints with authorization
- **Real-time Updates**: SSE-based live scoreboard updates  
- **Top 10 Leaderboard**: Displays the highest scoring users
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and spam requests
- **Input Validation**: Ensures data integrity

## Architecture Components

### 1. Authentication Service
- User login/logout functionality
- JWT token generation and validation
- Session management

### 2. Score Management Service  
- Score update operations
- Leaderboard calculations
- Data validation and sanitization

### 3. Server-Sent Events (SSE) Service
- Real-time client connections via HTTP streaming
- Score update broadcasts to all connected clients
- Connection lifecycle management with auto-reconnection
- JWT-based authentication for SSE connections

### 4. Database Layer
- User data storage
- Score persistence
- Optimized queries for leaderboard

### 5. Redis
- Cache the top 10 leaderboard

### Detailed Step-by-Step Process

#### Phase 1: User Authentication
1. **Login Request**: User submits credentials (username/password)
2. **Credential Validation**: Server validates against database
3. **JWT Generation**: Create signed JWT token with user info and expiration
4. **Response**: Return JWT token and user profile to client

#### Phase 2: SSE Connection Establishment
1. **SSE Request**: Client initiates SSE connection with JWT in Authorization header
2. **Token Validation**: Server validates JWT token
3. **Connection Setup**: Establish persistent HTTP connection
4. **Initial Data**: Send current leaderboard state to newly connected client

#### Phase 3: Score Update Workflow
1. **Action Trigger**: User performs an action in the application
2. **Score Request**: Client sends score update request with:
   - JWT token for authentication
   - Score increment value
   - Action type/context
3. **Authentication**: Verify JWT token validity
4. **Rate Limiting**: Check if user hasn't exceeded rate limits
5. **Input Validation**: Validate score increment (range, format)
6. **Database Update**: Update user's current score
7. **Cache Invalidation**: Clear leaderboard cache in Redis
8. **Leaderboard Recalculation**: Query new top 10 from database
9. **Cache Update**: Store new leaderboard in Redis
10. **Response**: Confirm score update to requesting client

#### Phase 4: Real-time Event Broadcasting
1. **Event Trigger**: Score service triggers SSE broadcast
2. **Broadcast to All**: Send events to all connected SSE clients:
   - `score_updated`: Individual score change
   - `leaderboard_updated`: New top 10 ranking
3. **Client Processing**: Connected clients receive and process events

#### Phase 5: Client-Side Handling
1. **Event Reception**: Client receives SSE events
2. **UI Updates**: Update scoreboard, user score, animations
3. **Error Handling**: Handle connection drops, reconnection
4. **State Synchronization**: Ensure UI reflects current server state

## Security Measures

### 1. Authentication
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt with salt)
- Token refresh mechanism

### 2. Authorization  
- All score update endpoints require valid JWT
- Verify token signature and expiration
- Check user permissions

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Limit score updates per user per minute (e.g., 10 requests/minute)
- API request throttling

### 4. Input Validation
- Sanitize all input data
- Validate score increment ranges (e.g., 1-100 points)

## Additional Implementation Comments

### ðŸ”§ Suggested Improvements

1. **Score Update Validation**
   - Consider adding action difficulty multipliers for different types of achievements
   - Add cooldown periods between score updates to prevent rapid-fire submissions

2. **Enhanced Security**  
   - Add audit logging for all score modifications
   - Add IP-based rate limiting alongside user-based limits

3. **Scalability Enhancements**
   - Use database read replicas for leaderboard queries
   - Consider implementing score update queues for high-traffic scenarios

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Consider implementing score aggregation jobs for reporting
   - Add response caching with proper invalidation strategies
   - Consider using Redis Sorted Set for better performance on getting Top 10 Leaderboard
   - Use connection pooling for SSE connections
   - Index on `current_score` for fast leaderboard queries

5. **Reliability & Fault Tolerance**
   - Implement SSE connection heartbeat/keepalive mechanism
   - Add automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Implement data backup and recovery strategies

These improvements should be prioritized based on expected user load, security requirements, and business objectives.
